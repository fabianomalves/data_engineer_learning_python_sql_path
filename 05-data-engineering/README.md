## 🏗️ Projects

### Project 1: Simple ETL Pipeline
Build an ETL pipeline that:
- Extracts data from CSV files
- Transforms and cleans the data
- Loads it into a database

### Project 2: Data Quality Framework
Create a data quality checking system that:
- Validates data types
- Checks for null values
- Identifies duplicates
- Generates quality reports

### Project 3: Automated Data Pipeline
Build an automated pipeline that:
- Runs on a schedule
- Processes incoming data
- Handles errors gracefully
- Sends notifications

## ⏱️ Estimated Time

4-6 weeks with hands-on projects

## ✅ Completion Checklist

- [ ] Understand ETL vs ELT
- [ ] Build a basic ETL pipeline
- [ ] Design a data warehouse schema
- [ ] Implement data quality checks
- [ ] Use Git for version control
- [ ] Complete all projects

## 🎯 Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: E-commerce Analytics
Design a data pipeline for an e-commerce company that:
- Ingests order data from multiple sources
- Processes customer behavior data
- Creates aggregated reports
- Feeds a dashboard

### Scenario 2: IoT Data Processing
Build a system to:
- Collect sensor data
- Clean and validate readings
- Store time-series data efficiently
- Generate alerts for anomalies

## 🔑 Key Concepts

### ETL Process
1. **Extract**: Pull data from source systems
2. **Transform**: Clean, validate, and reshape data
3. **Load**: Store data in target system

### Data Pipeline Components
- **Source**: Where data comes from
- **Ingestion**: How data is collected
- **Processing**: Data transformation logic
- **Storage**: Where data is stored
- **Orchestration**: How pipeline steps are coordinated

### Data Quality Dimensions
- **Accuracy**: Is the data correct?
- **Completeness**: Is all required data present?
- **Consistency**: Is data consistent across sources?
- **Timeliness**: Is data up-to-date?
- **Validity**: Does data follow business rules?

## 🛠️ Tools You'll Use

- **Python**: For data processing
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation
- **SQL**: For data querying
- **Git**: For version control
- **SQLite/PostgreSQL**: For data storage

## 💡 Best Practices

1. **Documentation**: Document your pipelines thoroughly
2. **Testing**: Test your data pipelines
3. **Monitoring**: Monitor pipeline health and data quality
4. **Idempotency**: Design pipelines to be rerunnable
5. **Error Handling**: Handle failures gracefully
6. **Scalability**: Design for growth
7. **Security**: Protect sensitive data
