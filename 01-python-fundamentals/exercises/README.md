## üß™ Testing Your Solutions

### Basic Testing
```python
# Test with different inputs
# Check edge cases
# Verify output matches expected

# Example:
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

# Test
assert add(2, 3) == 5
assert add(-1, 1) == 0
assert add(0, 0) == 0
print("All tests passed!")
```

## üí° Tips for Success

1. **Start Simple**: Get basic functionality working first
2. **Test Often**: Test after each small change
3. **Read Errors**: Error messages tell you what's wrong
4. **Use Print**: Print statements help debug
5. **Take Breaks**: Step away if stuck
6. **Ask for Help**: Use communities when truly stuck

## üìù Submission Guidelines

When practicing:
1. Create a file for each exercise (e.g., `exercise_01.py`)
2. Add comments explaining your approach
3. Test with multiple inputs
4. Compare with solution (if provided)
5. Refactor to improve code quality

## üéØ Bonus Challenges
