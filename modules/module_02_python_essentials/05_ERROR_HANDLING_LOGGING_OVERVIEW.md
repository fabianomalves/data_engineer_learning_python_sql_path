**What You'll Learn:**
- Industry best practices for error handling and logging
- Common pitfalls to avoid

**Key Topics:**

**Error Handling Best Practices:**
1. Be specific with exceptions (don't catch Exception for everything)
2. Never use empty except blocks (silent failures are dangerous)
3. Use finally for cleanup (or better: context managers)
4. Don't catch what you can't handle (let errors propagate)
5. Use custom exceptions for business logic

**Logging Best Practices:**
1. Choose the right log level
2. Include context in log messages
3. Log exceptions with stack traces
4. Don't log sensitive information (passwords, API keys)
5. Configure logging once, use everywhere

**Common Pitfalls:**
- Catching and re-raising without adding value
- Using bare except (catches system exits)
- Modifying mutable default arguments
- Ignoring return codes

**Practice Exercises (with complete solutions):**
1. **Error Handler Decorator** - Create a reusable decorator for error handling
2. **Retry Mechanism** - Implement a configurable retry decorator
3. **Data Validator Class** - Build a schema validation system

## 💡 Key Takeaways

### **Error Handling Principles:**

1. **Fail Fast, Fail Clearly**
   - Catch errors early and provide clear messages
   - Don't let bad data propagate through your pipeline

2. **Recover Gracefully**
   - Retry transient failures (network, database)
   - Continue processing when one record fails
   - Provide fallback values when appropriate

3. **Preserve Context**
   - Chain exceptions to show the full error path
   - Include relevant data in error messages
   - Log before re-raising

4. **Think About Your Caller**
   - Document what exceptions your functions raise
   - Use custom exceptions for domain logic
   - Return error status when appropriate

### **Logging Principles:**

1. **Log at Appropriate Levels**
   - DEBUG: Detailed diagnostic (development only)
   - INFO: Normal operations
   - WARNING: Something unexpected (but not an error)
   - ERROR: Something failed
   - CRITICAL: System might crash

2. **Include Context**
   - Who: Which module/function
   - What: What operation
   - When: Timestamp (automatic)
   - Why: Error message
   - Where: Line number, file (in production logs)

3. **Plan for Production**
   - Rotate log files to prevent disk space issues
   - Separate error logs for quick problem identification
   - Different log levels for development vs production
   - Never log sensitive information

4. **Make Logs Useful**
   - Include enough info to diagnose issues
   - Use consistent formatting
   - Log exceptions with stack traces
   - Add correlation IDs for tracking requests
